# TX-Pi apps
This repository provides applications which are specific for the
[TX-Pi](https://tx-pi.de/). Further, it is used as an additional application 
store.

This project is not a replacement for the [fischertechnik community 
firmware](https://cfw.ftcommunity.de/) store, but an addition. 

Ideally, all apps should work under the TX-Pi and the fischertechnik
TXT devices with the cfw. This project contains apps that do not make 
sense for the TXT device or only work with the TX-Pi due to technical 
limitations of the fischertechnik hardware.


## Usage as store

The store is pre-installed for all TX-Pi devices that use the current Raspbian 
Buster operating system. You can find the "TX-Pi Apps" store in the Store app. 
Click on the menu and then select "TX-Pi Apps".

If the store is not available on your device, select the menu and then "New". 
There you enter "TX-Pi Apps" for "Name" and "ftCommunity" for "User". 
Enter "tx-pi-apps" as the repository.
