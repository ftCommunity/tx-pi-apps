# TX-Pi apps
This repository provides applications which are specific for the
[TX-Pi](https://tx-pi.de/). Further, it is used as additional app shop.

This project is not a replacement for the [fischertechnik community 
firmware](https://cfw.ftcommunity.de/) shop, but an addition. 

Ideally, all apps should work under the TX-Pi and the cfw. This project 
contains apps that do not make sense for the cfw or only work with the 
TX-Pi due to technical limitations of the cfw hardware.
